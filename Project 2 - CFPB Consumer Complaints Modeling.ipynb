    "## The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a U.S. government agency that makes sure financial companies treat their customers fairly.

    "In other cases, they choose to dispute the resolution offered by the company.  (flagged in the 'Consumer disputed?' field).  In these situations, the bank has to perform additional investigations, and possibly offer further relief to the customers.  As a result, the cost of dealing with disputes can be high.\n",

    "Extra diligence: If the banks know in advance which complaints will be disputed, they can perform “extra diligence” during the first round of addressing the complaint with a view to avoiding eventual disputes.  Performing extra diligence costs $90 per complaint, and provides a guarantee that the customer will not dispute the complaint.  But performing the extra diligence is wasted money if the customer would not have disputed the complaint.\n",

    "\n",
    "The moment a complaint enters the CFPB’s system, there is 100 cost to resolve it.  This applies to every complaint.\n",
    "After that, if a complaint’s resolution is disputed by the customer, an additional 500 has to be spent (for a total cost for such cases to be 600).\n",
    "But the bank can intervene in advance by spending an extra $90 for extra diligence, and that can make sure the complaint’s resolution is not disputed. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "While we can’t prevent complaints from coming to the CFPB, we can reduce total costs by identifying the complaints that are likely to be disputed, and doing the extra due diligence for them.  This extra due diligence will cost us an extra $90 per complaint, but save us the additional $500 to resolve the complaint after the dispute.  But obviously, the bank would not want to spend this extra money on complaints that would not have been disputed anyway.\n",
