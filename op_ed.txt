May 2014 Code is complex, and in the coming days is going to get more complex. Over many generations of programming languages, we have increasingly abstracted ourselves away from the bits and bytes that run as machine code on the processor. That has allowed us to create increasingly complex software to a point where if you can dream it, you can code it. Our imagination is the only constraint on what software can do, which incidentally is also why software is eating jobs. Source code that humans write today is multiple layers of compilation and interpretation away from the zeroes-and-ones that ultimately runs on the microprocessor. Though the machine level code produced through these layers is less than perfectly optimized, that does not present a problem as both storage and computing are no longer constraints. Yet one problem it produces is that humans barely have any ability to understand the actual code that gets executed. Though there are decompilers, their ability to make apples out of applesauce is limited. The implication of that is with just about everything around us running code – the greeting card with a microcontroller that plays a tune and blinks LEDs, your car, your stereo, your television, your security system, your thermostat – we have absolutely no ability to judge the quality of the code, if we can get to it at all. Given the unknown provenance of most of this code, that is assuming it wasn't designed to attack you in the first place, or has been modified to do so. This problem is going to get more difficult. Mass production and miniaturization means there will be more microcontrollers and processors, and with radios built in with a view to network. Add to the mix flexible touch displays and incredibly inexpensive yet powerful sensors, the implications for security and privacy are monumental. In order to stay in control of our information and destinies, we will need to fundamentally rethink security along a dimension that looks at the problem differently from applying patches and firmware updates. What that answer is, if there is one, only time will tell.

In their special report on cyber security1, the Economist described our situation thus: "Defenders are like the batsmen in a cricket game who must deflect every ball heading for the stumps; hackers just need to knock off the bails once to win". We have heard similar defeatist words said in different ways, and the perception thus created in the minds of those we seek to protect does not make our jobs any easier. The argument may make naive logical sense, though as defenders we know that this is quite far from the truth and reality is complex. Attackers do not have it so easy, an attack is almost always an orchestrated series of many different steps each of which needs to be concluded with perfection. Even if a single one of these steps is foiled, the bails decline to come off. Defenders have a large number of easy steps they can take to foil attacks, and it really takes a skilled, focused and funded attacker to get through all the obstacles defenders can throw up at a relatively low cost. Continuing the cricket analogy, what the Economist ignores is that taking the bails off for one batsman does not matter much to the game as there is a line-up of ten batsmen to dismiss. And while bails measure 4-1/2 inches, the ball has to be thrown from a distance of 22 yards. Applying security updates to hosts in a timely way, restricting local administrative privileges on user machines, keeping malware definition files up-to-date, blocking ports that are not required, segmenting the network to keep sensitive data away from the DMZ and user networks, blocking web surfing from servers or non-user devices, keeping users educated, hardening and monitoring domain controllers, and using inexpensive or open-source vulnerability scans can foil all but the most determined attackers. If application whitelisting is practical, that makes the task of the attackers even more difficult. In short, we practitioners should take the message of keeping good hygiene to our management, and stress that defense is far from a lost cause as many pundits would have us believe.

Insider threats present a peculiar challenge to defenders. Most attacks come from the outside, which is understandable as the number of outsiders is numerically many times larger than the insiders, and outsiders enjoy advantages of costless and anonymous attacks. Insiders are more likely to have been vetted, would generally have their interests aligned with those of the organization, and have a personal and professional reputation to protect. While insiders are generally unlikely to be attackers, when they do turn rogue the risks they present are enormous. The most realized insider risk is data theft, though in extreme cases, malicious technologists have been known to abuse privileges to destroy or modify data, or even leave malicious destructive code behind. For defenders, this threat can be the most difficult to deal with, for it almost always involves attempting to detect abnormal behavior. What is to be considered abnormal is always difficult to define, and often relies upon using crude methods such as website uploads above a threshold, emails with certain attributes, regex matching etc. Since sensitive data need not be large, or even stand out much, these methods are generally not too successful, throwing up too many false positives as well as false negatives. Recent commercial offerings are attempting to determine what is 'abnormal' using mathematical algorithms that first define a base case, and then measure the distance of observed behavior from this normal. The challenge is that the degree of variability in everyday work is so high that the success of such algorithms can be questionable. While the science evolves, as it did for spam, we will need to continue to rely on policy enforcement, deterrence by publicly pursuing and making examples of discovered malicious acts, education and training, and age old controls such as restricting access to sensitive data on a need-to-know basis, segmenting networks, and implementing the full range of data leakage prevention controls as are practical.

The world around us continues to change rapidly. Hundreds of millions of people around the globe are getting connected to the internet for the first time, with a mobile device often bringing them their first connection point. Compute capabilities are expanding and becoming accessible to everyone through the cloud. Even if something isn’t a computer, it has a microcontroller embedded that now wants to get connected, if it is not already. Expanding browser capabilities mean the distinction between an installed application and what used to be ‘just a website’ is increasingly murky. The security challenges from these trends are enormous. Centralized risk functions will struggle to keep up with maintaining security, as scalability to the pervasiveness of such risks would be commercially infeasible to achieve for any single team at any organization. In bygone times that many of us still remember, a typists’ pool could manage the few documents that need to be typed. Today, when every thought and interaction needs to be typed, how many typists do we employ? Security could become everyone’s business, or else one may not have a job. A variety of questions – on who owns cyber defense and system compromise risks, who is responsible for managing the security posture, who provides risk expertise and advice, how are technology specific risk assessments performed, how risk is aggregated across the enterprise, how are risk decisions made, who provides risk monitoring and oversight services, and who manages the interface to the board – may need to be revisited.

Each day, the press is full of stories of cyber attackers of all stripes having a great deal of fun. Activists are busy defacing websites, or dos'ing them, ransomware peddlers are collecting whatever money they can, criminals are busy stealing credit card numbers and bank credentials in the tens of millions of records, money in bitcoin exchanges is disappearing without trace, and sometimes the exchanges have been vanishing as well. A fatigue of sorts is setting in, with the public increasingly indifferent to data theft – for when everyone’s financial record has been lost, the probability of a single individual being targeted for fraud by the bad guys is actually quite low. Yet we should not be settling for this state of affairs given the security and crypto tools we can have today. A data record of 40-odd unencrypted bytes need not be the single point of failure for financial data of any kind, whether it be an account or a credit card number. We must move to better standards for identifying individuals carrying out financial transactions, and make the loss of a credit card number, or an account & routing number combination, completely inconsequential. We should move security from monolithic databases that become single points of large scale failure, to a model where the database is only a part of the crypto puzzle to solve. Such advancements will limit the innovation and energy that the current system’s incentives are driving towards crime, hopefully directing the same bright individuals to more productive endeavors.

The internet of things is growing faster than anticipated. As any Arduino or PIC enthusiast will attest, advancements in sensor capabilities, declining cost of microcontrollers, and incredibly miniaturized radios mean that things that are not general purpose computers are getting connected to the internet at a rate that will continue to accelerate. We will find connected devices in our homes, on the streets and in the civilian utility infrastructure. In fact everything of value will be connected - if for no reason but to inform us that it is up and about, or let us know its location. Most of these devices have self-contained rudimentary computing capabilities in a sub-dollar microcontroller. Yet they almost always need to connect to a 'mothership' to pool, analyze and act upon the 'big-data' they collectively gather. Which makes sense, for that is when they are the most useful to us. They also need some form of connection to the human, which is increasingly provided by the smartphone. We are living in truly transformational times. As we watch this runaway expansion of the internet of things unfold around us, the implications for human welfare are enormous. The productivity gains, efficiencies and collaborative advances that this revolution brings will almost certainly power the next wave of economic expansion. Quantum computing may be next, but that is still far away. Ultimately, this information revolution which is far from over will prove to be as defining of our civilization’s progress as the steam engine, or the discovery of electricity. Yet concerns over privacy and security remain unanswered. The problem is simple to comprehend: ‘Secure my sensors, my smartphone, and all the pipes and aggregators in between in a way that I can keep the benefits of connected things, and be secure in the knowledge that no one can access the data the thing has, or be able to change it deceitfully, or destroy functionality’. In short, the classical confidentiality, integrity and availability paradigm still applies. Those who can offer solutions to this will certainly end up rich. But one thing is certain - the gains from the internet of things are so great that secure or not, here it comes and there is no stopping the juggernaut. In the lifetimes of the readers of this report, there will always be more information security problems to solve than the hands and minds available.

Earlier this month in February 2014, the Australian Department of Defense released a paper outlining key cyber defense strategies. According to this document1, titled "Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions", most low sophistication attacks and as many as 85% of the targeted cyber intrusions could be prevented by following the top 4 mitigation strategies: ? use application whitelisting to help prevent malicious software and unapproved programs from running ? patch applications such as Java, PDF viewers, Flash, web browsers and Microsoft Office ? patch operating system vulnerabilities ? restrict administrative privileges to operating systems and applications based on user duties. To the readers of this report, this would make intuitive sense. While some of cyber defense is indeed rocket science, a lot of it is process, hard work and organizational discipline. Risk management is everyone's business in an organization, and is not limited to specialized risk groups. Patching, hardening, monitoring for vulnerabilities should be embedded in the operational IT processes performed by technology packaging and deployment teams. Ensuring that administrative privileges are restricted should be a part of business as usual - particularly on end-points where email is read and the web is browsed.

Cyber attacks increase costs for companies, and in turn, for consumers. Defenses do not come free, and represent human effort that could have been expended on improving our standards of living rather than battling those who wish to steal or sabotage. One wonders as to at what stage does the cost become high enough to constitute serious harm, and have we already crossed that threshold. While for most companies the cost of implementing and maintaining a high state of cyber security is yet another overhead, for others it may be the tipping point that endangers survival. One also wonders as to at what point do attacks constitute a harm so grievous as to make it a responsibility for law enforcement to provide protection to private enterprise; and for nation states, when do attacks constitute an act of war by an enemy requiring a response that goes beyond cyber defense. These and other similar questions are likely to be raised in the days ahead as attacks get more pernicious and set new bounds of their reach. Our question of the month asked about cyber insurance. Insurance collectivizes the risk for an affected population, and limits each participant’s risk to the group’s average risk in the form of periodic premiums. Each participant is able to escape the binary outcome of catastrophic risk. Or so the theory goes. Given the nature of cyber security risk, moral hazard is ever present. An organization may lose interest in protecting itself if insurance is available. The organizers of insurance pools, viz the insurance companies, lack actuarial estimates and historical data and are challenged by pricing. In offering coverage, they face systematic risks in the form of the overall cyber security environment of the kind this Index seeks to measure, as well as specific risks that are unique to the organization being insured. Both kinds of risks are difficult to measure and express as probabilistic distributions that could be used to drive premium calculations.

A big challenge for defenders in all organizations has been the inability to keep up with the inventory of technologies that are deployed across the network. Writers of standards and policies almost always ask for the creation and up-to-date maintenance of a good inventory as a necessary part of robust protection. Real practitioners know that this can be a challenge at even the smallest scales, leave alone large organizations that have grown through organic entrepreneurial growth as well as acquisition of competitors and startups. Just about everything that is connected to the network is now under attack, whether it be voice and multimedia systems, phones, printers, faxes, network devices, appliances of all varieties that organizations collect over time, building control systems, mobile devices and needless to say, the plethora of software that accumulates over time on servers and desktops. There is no practical way to document or inventory all of these wide variety of technologies without spending an extraordinary amount of money and time – at a scale that is commercially infeasible for most organizations. At the same time, it is also clear that the challenge of reliable inventory will continue to stare us in the face as technology adoption proliferates in response to customer needs and competitive pressures. While legacy inventory can be a challenge, processes can be put in place to document all new technology, be it hardware, software, platforms or frameworks, being adopted. Over time, a credible inventory data source will emerge. If this inventory could be cleanly tagged with a standard identification scheme, such as Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) as laid out by the OVAL framework, a robust foundation for security automation can be created.

Verifying the identity of another human is not a new challenge, and the basic mechanisms of establishing identity have not really changed much over the centuries. It has always been one (or more) of what one knows, or what one has - the latter including physical possessions, personal attributes such as a face that the other party recognizes, or the ability to write your name in a relatively unique fashion. In the what-one-knows category, passwords are as old as human civilization. With current technology, a password that is safely ensconced in the neurons and brain tissue of a person is safe from discovery or stealth. A ‘good’ password is probably more secure than a token or other physical possession used to establish identity. Yet the weakest link for an unknowable piece of information such as the password (or a private key) is the moment when it is transcribed on to a keyboard, or sent as electrical impulses on a wire. This fundamental limitation where a password is no longer secure the moment it is expressed outside the neuron-tissue infrastructure applies to other means of authentication as well - including biometry. Just as the bits and bytes that comprise the password can be captured, in the same way the bits and bytes generated from a retina, fingerprint or face scan can be similarly stolen and successfully reproduced at a later time. This risk is greater when the device that captures the password, or scans the biometric information, is under the control of an attacker. As sensors, computing capability and machine-motor-skills combine in the coming years, these new machines/robots will need their own means of establishing identity to perform the functions their human masters will assign them. The underlying assumption that the human himself or the essence of his or her consciousness cannot be replicated will also be tested in the coming decades. The security business has more problems to solve than the lifetime the readers of this report are afforded.

Though the question is certainly not new, we have seen an intensification of the debate around privacy. According to a paper1 published as far back as 1974, the term ‘privacy’ was described to denote a socially defined ability of an individual (or organization) to determine whether, when, and to whom personal (or organizational) information is to be revealed. A glib argument one occasionally hears in the privacy debate is that if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear from a loss of privacy. But this argument is dismantled quite easily – the loss of privacy for society as a whole can undermine a great deal more. Private information can be used for espionage, surveillance, and of course voyeurism by others who have no business to know2. The surveillance aspect is particularly malevolent, because the ability to put seemingly disconnected and individually unimportant data side-by-side can create a collage far more detailed than its individual parts. If those who are surveilled are aware of being in such an observable state, it affects their behavior, and compromises freedom by creating anticipatory compliance with what they believe will be liked by the observers. The freedom to think and behave differently from one another is what has underpinned the success of our civilization. Societies that require their people to conform to a tightly scripted way of living and thinking inevitably decline and decay, though they may have ephemeral successes. Our civilization needs only a few basic rules to guide behavior, and lots of free people if we are to keep moving forward on the scientific path that rejects the notion that some apparatchiks know what the best for the rest of us is3. A large scale loss of privacy will lead over time to a new equilibrium where just such an unaccountable elite exists, and everyone else conforms.

To many people, particularly those who are informed by popular media, the world of cyber security may appear to be an emergent battlefront. Yet the fact is that attacks on computers and networks have been around for as long as computers have held valuable information. As early as 1972, a 'hacker' used an audio tone at the right frequency to unlock AT&T's phone network, allowing free calls and manipulation of the network. In 1983, the FBI busted the "414s," a group of young hackers who broke into several U.S. government networks using an Apple II+ computer and a modem. The Morris worm struck ARPANET in 1988, disabling 6000 hosts. In 1998, 'Solar Sunrise' affected Sun Solaris computers across military and industry networks, and from the late 90s onwards the onslaught has been relentless1. The motivation of the attackers has not changed – espionage, data destruction, denial-of-service – and defenders have not sat idly by either. Pretty Good Privacy, PGP, was released first in 1991, the same year that Norton anti-virus was released. MIT developed Kerberos in the ‘80s to protect network services. So while attackers and defenders have both been around since the early days of the computer, the state of cyber security today is not the same as cyber security twenty years ago. One difference obviously is the scale, computer systems have grown from a few hundred thousand nodes to billions today. While a lot of our defenders, both in the private and public sector are new to the field, historical lessons are still relevant today. What this also means is that while weapons and defenses may get upgraded over time, the defenders will still be relevant a generation from now. The profession will continue to expand, and gains will continue to accrue to those who invent newer defenses.

The scale of the Target data breach and the details of how long the intrusion and data exfiltration went on for continue to filter in. The number of people and the extent of the information possibly lost is stunning, and while the jury is still out on if Target did enough to secure its digital infrastructure, what happened to them could happen to just about anyone – including those of us reading this report. POS systems, printers, appliances with single-purpose operating systems, and anything with an IP address (and not just endpoints or servers) should all be considered expected targets. Therefore the first thing we in the security business need to do is to know enough about all of them in our environment as to be able to secure them all, or at least reasonably so. We should know where they are, what information they hold, and what data passes or can pass through them. Second, we also have to plan on the assumption that the bad guys are already in, and the question then becomes as to how we prevent them from getting out. Analysis of network traffic and of outgoing connections becomes the key to fouling the bad guys' plans. As practitioners we know that is easier said than done given the volumes of data being exchanged, and is certainly impossible for encrypted web traffic unless man-in-the-middle proxies set up by organizations intercept all encrypted traffic first. Such MITM technologies create additional privacy headaches for organizations, because once you have your employees' credentials to their banks, doctors, utilities and what have you, you also have the responsibility to keep it safe. All this work is not going to come free, and we can expect security costs pushing up the cost of doing business. One would expect that a third layer of protection would be provided by law enforcement, that you can steal my information to your heart’s content – but if you choose to hurt me, the police will catch you. Obviously, this does not yet apply if the bad guys are in countries who couldn't care less so long as their own citizens aren't targeted, but over time this must change too.

Humans have battled each other for superiority over the millennia, and that is not new at all. But all past conflicts of any significance have by-and-large had a common element: the ultimate use of physical force to harm the opponent, and the ability of the parties to reasonably determine where the attack is coming from. Whether the physical force is applied in a hand-to-hand combat, or using a ballistic missile, adversaries have the ability to physically observe each other’s actions, and react in a strategic way that suits their self-interest best at that time. Battles in the cyber arena follow a completely different rule set altogether. There is no physical action to observe, as the human eye cannot observe the bits and bytes travelling in ether. Attacks can be launched through other compromised locations, something difficult to do in the physical world. Anonymity of the attacker, the low cost of attacks, and a physical distance from where the damage occurs removes any restraints of the kind that currently apply to most physical warfare. As cyber defenders, we are aware of the seriousness of the threat, though the average business executive does not yet consider cyber threats to be anything greater than an annoyance to be dealt with. After all, ‘nobody dies’ from a cyber attack. Thankfully. And only thus far. As processing technology is increasingly integrated with the physical world, whether it be through driverless cars, civilian drones or dyi arduino robots, the same lack of attribution and accountability that has made cyber space incredibly insecure will come to affect our physical world. Cyber threats will then become a true matter of life-and-death in everyday life for the everyday citizen, having placed in the hands of the pedestrian variety malcontent weapons capable of being controlled from afar while staying hidden. We are only a few years away from where serious cyber threats will not merely be incredible stories of melting nuclear reactors and exploding power grids that one enjoys and dismisses as flights of Hollywood fancy, but could be waiting for us around the block. Societal reaction could be severe, the freedom of the internet could become the cause for its ultimate enslavement.

A question we get asked, and also often ask ourselves, is if the Index is useful and relevant to our respondents and their colleagues. Our goals for the Index have been ambitious: we would like it to support decision making, provide the basis for a thoughtful conversation, compare individual perspectives with those of the educated 'crowd', and canvass viewpoints on issues of topical interest. Over time, we hope to enhance and extend the Index in a way that provides for hedging against cyber security risk. From the feedback we have received from our respondents, it appears that different respondents are using the Index in different ways, and in particular some have highlighted using the Index, specifically sub-index data, as a means to highlight risk or advance an argument with organizational decision makers. Going forward, we would like to enhance the presentation of our monthly analysis in a way that the data can be directly used by respondents in their jobs. In particular, given that PowerPoint is the defacto currency for circulating organizational ideas, we would like to make available PowerPoint friendly images as part of our detailed report that could potentially be directly used in organizational presentations. We would ideally like to share the data with you electronically, for example, as an image or a CSV file using some sort of access controlled mechanism. We are also looking for ideas on data presentation and visualization, and what kinds of information from the sub-indices would make sense when analyzed in a certain way. If you have any thoughts or ideas on the matter, please do get in touch with us.

It is a familiar story across all organizations: resources are stretched thin, double digit out-of-band patches to apply each month, and hundreds of vulnerabilities to review. There is network traffic to examine, hosts to pen-test, websites to block, spam & phishing to deal with, IDS logs to examine, and for what it may be worth, update anti-virus signatures multiple times a day. Cybersecurity is as much a fast moving assembly line as it is a bespoke work product. Many of us are looking to automate a lot of the process work that is essential for maintaining a minimum security baseline, and the effort is akin to changing tires on a moving car. But because attacks are relentless, and the attackers organized, funded and patient, defense therefore needs to be equally relentless. It will need to be as reliant upon smart technology to make it ever tougher for a bad guy to get in, and even tougher to get anything out even if someone were to get in. As we had observed in a prior edition of the report, the cyber battle of the future will be fought between machines, and data will provide the ammunition. The battle is likely to stay asymmetrical unless defenders can and do go on the offensive in some practical way.

Our Index has shown that data theft is considered a much greater risk than data modification or destruction. That is understandable if the premise is that the attackers wish to steal intellectual or financial wealth. Yet there is a class of attackers among the ranks of both hacktivists and nation states who would be quite pleased to wreak destruction on targets’ data, as the attacks on Saudi Aramco have recently shown. Tens of thousands endpoints had their data completely wiped out, and one can only imagine the disruption and pain that might occur if something like that were to happen to patient records, payment systems or providers of services such as payroll or mortgage processors. Securing data is important, but ensuring availability, backups and process resilience is going to be equally important. It is only a matter of time before we see a reckless attack of this nature inflicted on the civilized world.

it worth their while to invest enough in tools and processes that would ensure that security patches are applied in a timely way, anti-virus definitions and engines are always up-to-date on all hosts, and devices are upgraded with the most recent software. The means of ingress in most attacks, including some recent high profile ones, is fairly predictable: get someone to visit a site or open a document with a payload that will scan their machine for a missing patch on Windows, or Flash Player, or Adobe Reader or Java, and depending upon whatever is vulnerable, get in control and hand the keys over to the command-and-control masters that will then use the beachhead to try moving laterally. While malcode can enter an organization in various ways – the web, a storage device, often USB based, or over email – and signature based detection has obvious limitations, application whitelisting can be an effective complementary protection strategy. By limiting the code and applications that can be run on a user's computer, the ability of malware to infect can be significantly curtailed. While the recent successful targeting of Bit9, an application whitelisting service, may have invited deserved sneers and criticism, to us the fact that the bad guys would have needed to do that to infiltrate their client organizations speaks to the effectiveness of this strategy. These strategies certainly do bring their own share of operational pain for users and administrators alike, but are worth pursuing for anyone seriously interested in protection.

The key to successful defense in the future lies in superior use of security technology and tools. The cyber security marketplace is seeing a great deal of innovation and the industry has been attracting serious investor money. Not all products will ultimately be successful, but the concepts and newer and insightful ways of thinking that they bring makes us believe that the future of security technology is exciting. Many of these products will rely upon advanced analytic and machine learning algorithms that will mimic human decision making, and be intuitively able to make a reasonably accurate decision as to whether a particular action is benign or malicious. Protection will need to be increased around internet infrastructure, and a number of services such as those provided by private groups such as spamhaus need to considered a part of the infrastructure to secure. But creating stronger defenses is only one side of the picture. One also hopes that over time international law gets institutionalized in a way that cyber criminals or hacktivists have nowhere to call sanctuary, and that national espionage actors draw a line around who they consider legitimate targets, leaving private enterprise and intellectual property alone. Both these efforts, ie, the drive to build stronger machine based defenses that operate largely autonomously as to be affordable by all, and the need to build multilateral consensus around protecting cyberspace need to continue in tandem. Just like international shipping or commercial aviation is largely unaffected by nation-state conflicts, cyber security needs to be similarly guaranteed. There is a need for geeks, and there is a need for wonks.

Threats continue to proliferate, and the weapons available to attackers are more powerful than ever. Malicious actors may be difficult to detect, leave alone evict, if they are able to get a toehold inside. With every endpoint exposed to the internet and the boundaries between the inside and the outside getting blurred, a single successful exploitation may be enough to provide that toehold. Yet significant advancement in protection can be achieved by the simplest of steps: making sure all security updates are applied without exception, nothing vulnerable is visible at the perimeter, ports and traffic are monitored, and web proxies are configured with controls to protect against malware and malicious sites. While security comes at a cost, managing many of these basic hygiene principles need not take much more than discipline and persistence, management sponsorship and leadership from IT risk managers. Managing patches across platforms, applications and devices is a challenge in itself, often complicated by the problem of unreliable inventory. A disciplined patch application process supported by a strong mandate from senior management can often make the needed difference for the organization’s security. There are multiple open source vulnerability scanning and identification tools available, and lists of malicious websites in the public domain that can be leveraged to protect against the vast majority of attacks that occur. Once these basics are taken care of, focus can shift and attention be given to the more insidious targeted threats that often sneak under the cover of the noise the pedestrian variety attacks generate.

There are neighborhoods where you can leave your doors unlocked in confidence that nobody will burgle your house. And there are others where no number of locks will provide much protection. Cyberspace is a dangerous neighborhood today, but that is not what it needs to always remain. A key issue with Internet safety is that it is difficult to identify the bad guys – “attribution” is extremely challenging. Criminal gangs as well as sovereigns would find it difficult to do what they do with impunity if they could be tracked down and identified with credible technical certainty, but so would human rights workers and whistleblowers. At the same time, the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, and on the Internet liberty depends on privacy, and privacy depends on anonymity. For bad guys (with ‘bad’ being relative to one’s perspective), the ability to stay anonymous – a strategic option for all players – has near-zero downside for the individual actor. Criminally speaking, the player who does not exercise the anonymity option to subvert other peoples’ liberty and steal their property operates at a disadvantage. Once again, securityrelated technology and practices are (always) dual use. If we could break the relationship between privacy and anonymity, to assure privacy without a guarantee of absolute anonymity, we might have hopes of breaking this contradiction. Conceptually this may not be too different from offering identification before boarding a plane, or having a license plate on your car.

Attacks are increasing, though the vast majority do not require much sophistication on the part of the attackers. The denial of service attacks and website defacements we have been witnessing are having the effect of creating the attention and hype that the attackers seek. These attacks may sting, but are difficult to imagine as causing lasting damage. While it is important for the security professional to protect against the mosquito bites in the cyber jungle, he or she would do well to also not lose sight of the big carnivores that may be lurking. The truly insidious attacks are likely to come from sophisticated players who are after national, commercial or industrial information, and such actors are likely to be as sophisticated in hiding their tracks. From the perspective of these attackers, it may be beneficial to have a heightened noise level that drowns any real signals. A strategy we in the security space would do well to guard against. Respondents have mentioned the growth of new technologies as newer sources of risk, primarily citing the rise of the cloud and virtualization technologies and the ceding of control to some degree that their adoption inevitably involves. It is concerning to see that security and privacy are still an afterthought for vendors of mobile technologies, inspite of their rapid adoption by corporations.

At the risk of sounding repetitive, the simplest measures provide the most effective control against the vast majority of cyber threats. Large organizations with tens or even hundreds of thousands of end-points struggle with getting a near 100% coverage for basic security measures such as updated AV and security patching. 99% may not be good enough, for the last 1% may represent hundreds of vulnerable machines. Organizational constructs and reporting lines matter too. Maintaining cyber security requires coordination across multiple tools and processes likely run by separate teams. It may become difficult to maintain a strong defensive stance if responsibility for cyber security is spread across organizational stove pipes. Teams responsible for IDS/IPS, penetration testing, web proxies, anti-virus and malware detection, log-analysis, incident response and others need to be able to provide coordinated responses to threats.

A variety of technical, regulatory and industry changes continue to make the threat environment more complex. Legislators across the world are responding with more regulation. (As an example, the US Congress alone is considering multiple versions of competing cyber security legislative proposals.) Defense establishments across the world are girding for new battles, with increasing outlays for cyber attacks as well as defense. Vendors are responding with newer products, many of which use techniques from the discipline of data analysis and machine learning to identify unusual patters and traffic. This is an arms race being fought in the intellectual arena. And as we have witnessed in the 'real' arms race, first against a clearly identified enemy and now against more scattered foes, humans will ultimately cede control to machines who will conduct the battle in real time with human judgment coming into play only as a post mortem exercise to further tweak the machine. This trend of increasing reliance on machines to protect against other machines will be inevitable given the speeds at which the good guys need to react to offense, and will bring newer risks of their own. While at this point security professionals struggle with comprehending and managing the risk from newer technologies and platforms such as mobile technologies and the cloud, the future security professional will have a role closer to that of the data scientist. Attacks in the future will not carry precise signatures that can be matched exactly, but will need an analysis of what things look and smell like. This will require an ability to develop and execute detection capabilities based on data mining based predictions and statistical analysis. ------

As the last month has shown, attacks are mechanized and launched on an industrial scale, with machines attempting to find chinks in the armor of other machines. The speed and volume of attacks requires real-time diagnostics and defensive responses that cannot be provided by human operators. Clearly, much like the offense, the defense needs to react with smarter use of CPU cycles. Much of the defense requires significant statistical and data mining capabilities to separate the signal from the noise and adopt the right defense. While the marketing hype surrounding ‘big data’ is distractive at best, there is no doubt security professionals have to become a lot more data savvy. Digital footprints available in the form of system and web traffic logs are vast oceans that can churned only using algorithms to determine anomalies and departures from the normal, and identifying patterns of interest. This is easier said than done. Current tools have limitations, and require a significant investment in customization as well as skills. The security professional of the future will be as much a data scientist as a network engineer. As organizations grow, security tools proliferate, presenting their own maintenance and skill challenges. As they embed themselves into processes that over time come to be regarded as essential, they can be difficult to dislodge and replace with improvements. We asked our respondents how many of their current security products would they still keep if they could have a fresh start. On average, the results showed that one in three currently used security products would be thrown away if starting from scratch were to be an option. While hindsight is always 20/20, choose your security products well. ------

The attention that national leaders1 and bureaucrats have given the matter of cybersecurity over the past few weeks has been interesting to observe. The threat has been called an “existential threat”, visions of a cyber 9/11 have been evoked, and has been called the most serious challenge to national security since the onset of the nuclear age sixty years ago2. As the people who ply this trade, we do not disagree. The proposed responses to this threat provoke thought. Lawmakers would legislate a robust public-private partnership, require the owners of critical infrastructure to participate in a ‘voluntary’ cybersecurity program, and establish a multi-agency government council to ensure adequate practices are adopted to secure systems from attacks. While the intentions of decision makers in these matters cannot be doubted, it is unclear how more legislation, and the resulting compliance and audit requirements could not but detract an already stressed private sector from the real tasks of protection. ------

It is clear that nation states are beefing up their cyber attack arsenal and capabilities. Not only do they have large financial resources, they also have access to top talent (think ‘serving the country’). Unlike cyber criminals, their attacks are not motivated by immediate financial gain, and unlike hacktivists, they do not seek publicity either. And unlike dull attacks based on known vulnerabilities, their weapons probably comprise unknown yet powerful ‘zero-days’, many of which will never be known. Only time will tell if corporate and institutional defenses can stand up to such attacks. And only time alone will tell if the nation state involvement transforms the responsibility for securing IT into public goods, such as national defense or environmental protection. But the risk for now is real, and for those responsible for critical infrastructure including companies that are a part of the global financial plumbing, paranoia is justified. But paranoia is not a strategy. How can risk professionals provide their management some level of assurance that they are indeed protected? Hardening known defenses, analyzing outbound traffic, detecting anomalous software and files, and securing devices such as printers and network devices can help protect against many attacks. It is surprising how many organizations continue to fall victim to their executives clicking on phishing links. Removing administrative access and improving awareness (eg, by conducting mock phishing exercises) can additionally make it tougher even for a determined attacker to get in easily.

The Internet continues to expand tying humanity together into a collective consciousness. Organizations continue to deal with commercial and security challenges presented by new frontiers such as IPv6, the cloud, BYOD, social networks and so on. With a vulnerable browser on every endpoint, there is no longer a distinction to be made between what is on the 'perimeter' and what is not. At home, cyberspace evolves into the 'thingternet', with cars, phones, tablets, game consoles, televisions, home alarms systems, all connecting to the Internet - to receive instructions from their human masters on what to do and when, and in some cases from other devices who ultimately (at least for now) have a human master. The technological change is matched by societal changes. A survey referred to in a recent issue of the Economist magazine1 revealed that nearly 40% of respondents in China would rather give up sex for a year than the Internet. In the United States, over 80% were willing to give up fast food for a year instead of the Internet. Yet for something that is emerging as an essential part of our lives as social beings and economic producers, and the bedrock of the civilization our children would inherit, it is unacceptably insecure, unsafe and untrustworthy. A lot more needs to be done, by scientists, technologists, security specialists, government and civil society. This Index project that you are a part of hopes to shine a light on the malady, and to measure the temperature that our patient is running.

While the “occupy” protests seemed to create the fear of an increasing threat from hacktivists, an interesting observation brought out by respondents’ comments was the increasing intersection between government policy and private efforts. Notable in this context are the new guidelines1 issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission relating to disclosure by public companies regarding cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents. The trend of ongoing improvement in the extent of information sharing continued in the current month. One respondent cited a new regional data sharing initiative as an example of such cooperation.

The Index value at the end of May stood at 1043.2, as compared to 1021.6 at the end of the previous month. If the rate of increase over the past two months were to be sustained, we would see the risk perception double in about three years (or half the rate of Moore’s Law). But we do not believe even for a moment that the future is predictable in such a frivolous way. This is because the world of cyber security professionals is different each day as sources of risks and threats evolve. Events cannot be modeled as stochastic, nor do they fit neat distributional assumptions. Discontinuities and surprises are the norm, rather than being the rare ‘black swans’. Risks in our world are instead created by informed and increasingly sophisticated threat agents acting strategically as if in a game. In this world, data is not only sparse, it can also not be projected to the future as both attackers and defenders inoculate their strategies using what is already known. Which is why a perception based index of cyber security based on the experience of professionals is probably the most reliable guide to the risk facing the defenders.

From the results of the survey over the past few months it appears that there is a consensus emerging around the significance of the threat from counterparties and activists-hacktivists. As one of our respondents noted (see comments section), the ‘partner problem’ is a matter of significant concern to security professionals. Since security does not come free, partners in the extended enterprise may be understandably reluctant to do any more than the minimum necessary to sustain the relationship. In our view, for service providers to adopt such an approach reflects a short term focus. Without adequate information protection safeguards in place, it is inevitable that information will some day be lost or compromised. Such events can be an end-of-game event for firms, even if the information suspected to be compromised is never actually misused. -------

The internet has made possible global collaboration on a scale unmatched in human history. Connected computer networks have brought about multi-fold advances in economic productivity, benefitting the rich and poor alike across the globe. In the interest of the advancement of human welfare, it is imperative that the internet be kept safe for businesses and individuals. This cannot be accomplished merely by individual organizations responding to threats in an ever escalating arms race. We need to avoid turning the internet into a battlefield where ideologues and criminal groups can hurt legitimate businesses at will, or where state sponsored hacking used as a military tool can be used to impair commercial targets. To avoid such an outcome, a lot will need to be done on the regulatory and public policy front. While a premature idea at this stage, what is required is coordinated global action, preferably enforced by multilateral treaties of the kind that govern other threats to humanity. ------

Respondents expressed frustration with regulation, citing increasing pressure relating to compliance. This coexists together with the sentiment that the government needs to do more and not less. Worries relating to outsourcing, media perception and the intensity of low cost attacks such as phishing and a general rise in intrusion pressure were other key themes. -
